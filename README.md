# 464-BlogWebsite
This is the blog we made for our 464 class final project

## How To Run
Your first need to setup the `Backend` then setup the `Frontend`.
Both are setup using the terminal.

### Backend
1. Open a terminal *(use a sperate instace of the terminal for the `Frontend` and `Backend`)*
2. `cd` into the following directory `~/464-BlogWebsite/sisyphs-blog-backend`
3. run the command `npm update` *(this command only needs to be run once)*
4. run the command `node app`.  You should then see output indicating that the backend is running.

### Frontend
1. Open a terminal *(use a sperate instace of the terminal for the `Frontend` and `Backend`)*
2. `cd` into the following directory `~/464-BlogWebsite/sisyphs-blog-backend`
3. run the command `npm update` *(this command only needs to be run once)*
4. run the command `npm start`.  This should then open a new browser tab with the website

### CRITICAL
Make sure you STOP ALL RUNNING TERMINALS before closing them.  This can be done by pressing `CTRL+C` inside any terminal *(You'll know it worked because you'll be able to input new commands to the terminal)*.  If you don't do this it WILL PREVENT you from RUNNING any OTHER INSTANCES.  *(If you do make this mistake you must find the running tasks PID and use the `taskkill` command with this PID.  Or just reboot your PC)*.
